## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **E-AC-3 multichannel full-bandwidth AHT decode** — round 110. Extends
  the round-6 mono-only Adaptive Hybrid Transform path to any number of
  fbw channels. The §3.4.2 helper variables `nchregs[ch]` / `ncplregs` /
  `nlferegs` are now computed (`eac3::dsp::compute_aht_regs`) directly
  from the per-block exponent strategies already parsed onto `AudFrm`
  (`chexpstr_blk_ch`, `cplexpstr_blk` + `cplstre_blk`, `lfeexpstr`) — the
  spec derives these from the bitstream rather than transmitting them, and
  every input is available before the AHT anchor, so no real audblk
  pre-walk is needed. `parse_phase_b` then reads `chahtinu[ch]` for every
  fbw channel whose `nchregs[ch] == 1` (the AHT-eligibility gate: exponents
  sent exactly once per 6-block frame). The previous hardcoded mono path
  (`nfchans == 1 && !lfeon && ncplblks == 0`, single `nchregs[0] = 1` hint)
  is gone.
  * **Cross-channel mantissa grouping fix**: the standard (non-AHT)
    channels in a mixed frame now share the bap-1/2/4 triplet/pair
    grouping buffers across channels in frequency-then-channel order via
    the canonical `audblk::fetch_mantissa`, matching base AC-3 §7.3.5.
    Round 6's `unpack_one_channel_scalar` used per-channel grouping state
    that was only correct for the single-channel case; it is removed. The
    bap=0 dither now also uses the base path's §7.3.4 LFSR (the round-6
    scalar path zeroed dithered bins). The mono AHT fixture never reached
    the scalar path (its only channel takes the AHT branch), so this
    change has no effect on the previously-passing case.
  * **Coupling-AHT (`cplahtinu`) and LFE-AHT (`lfeahtinu`)** synthesis
    remain deferred: such frames are rejected as `Unsupported` after the
    regs-driven phase-B parse confirms the flag is set, instead of the
    old blanket multichannel reject. Multichannel fbw AHT now decodes.
  * 4 unit tests (`eac3::dsp::aht_regs_tests`) cover the nchregs /
    ncplregs / nlferegs counting rules and the `nchregs == 1`
    eligibility pattern.

- **E-AC-3 transient pre-noise processing (TPNP) decode** — round 103.
  Implements the §E.3.7.2 PCM-domain time-scaling synthesis, replacing
  the round-2 whole-frame reject (`transproce == 1` previously errored
  the entire syncframe, muting otherwise-decodable audio).
  * **Parse** (`eac3::audfrm::parse_tail`): the per-fbw-channel
    `chintransproc[ch]` (1 bit), `transprocloc[ch]` (10 bits, in
    4-sample units), and `transproclen[ch]` (8 bits) are now stored on
    `AudFrm` instead of being read-and-discarded for cursor alignment.
  * **Synthesis** (`eac3::dsp::apply_transient_prenoise`, called after
    overlap-add): for each fbw channel carrying TPNP data it (1) derives
    `transloc = 4·transprocloc`, the containing audio block's leading
    edge `aud_blk_samp_loc`, the pre-noise length `pnlen`, and the total
    correction length `tot_corr_len = pnlen + translen + TC1`; (2) copies
    a `2·TC1 + pnlen`-sample synthesis buffer from earlier (cleaner)
    PCM; (3) overwrites the pre-transient region with three windows —
    fade-out/in over `TC1 = 256`, full synth overwrite, fade-in/out over
    `TC2 = 128` — using complementary Hann cross-fades (the spec permits
    "nearly any pair of constant-amplitude cross-fade windows"). LFE
    never carries TPNP; the baseband decode is untouched (TPNP is a
    quality enhancement on already-valid samples).
  * **Cross-frame note**: §E.3.7.1 allows a frame-N transient to
    reference frame-(N-1) tail samples; the round-103 path clamps such
    reads to index 0 (conservative single-frame behaviour) and a future
    round can thread the previous frame's tail through
    `Eac3DecoderState`.
  * 4 unit tests in `eac3::dsp::tpnp_tests` cover the no-op cases
    (transient at/after frame end, block-aligned transient), the
    constant-signal-survives-cross-fade invariant, and the region-2
    full-overwrite-equals-synthesis-source property.
- **E-AC-3 spectral extension (SPX) decode** — round 100. Implements
  the §E.2.3.3 SPX strategy + coordinate syntax and the §E.3.6
  high-frequency regeneration, replacing the round-4 `spxinu == 1`
  mute path.
  * **Parse** (`eac3::dsp`): `chinspx[ch]`, `spxstrtf`, `spxbegf`,
    `spxendf`, `spxbndstrce` + `spxbndstrc[]` (Table E2.11 default
    banding), and the per-channel coordinate block `spxcoe` /
    `spxblnd` / `mstrspxco` / `spxcoexp` / `spxcomant`.
  * **Synthesis** (`audblk::apply_spectral_extension`, called from
    `dsp_block` between rematrix and dynrng): transform-coefficient
    translation with the §E.3.6.4.1 wrapping copy cursor, banded RMS
    energy, spxblnd-derived noise/signal blending (§E.3.6.4.2), and
    `spxco·32` coordinate scaling (§E.3.6.4.3). The SPX-channel
    `end_mant` is extended to the SPX end so dynrng + IMDCT process
    the regenerated bins. Base AC-3 never sets `in_spx`, so this is a
    no-op there.
  * **Cursor-drift derivations** now spec-correct on SPX frames:
    `endmant[ch] = spxbandtable[spx_begin_subbnd]` (§E.3.3.3),
    `cplendf` derived from `spxbegf` when SPX is in use (§E.3.3.1),
    and `nrematbd` folding in SPX via `remat_band_count_spx`
    (§E.3.3.2).
  * The §E.3.6.4.2 noise generator is non-normative per spec; a
    deterministic 32-bit xorshift LFSR (`spx_noise`) keeps decodes
    reproducible.
  * 5 unit tests in `audblk::spx_tests` cover `spx_bandtable`, the
    coordinate-decode formula, default-banding band sizing, the
    end-to-end copy+scale synthesis, and the disabled no-op.
- **E-AC-3 D25 exponent-group-count fix** — round 100. `nchgrps` for
  the D25 strategy used `(endmant−1).div_ceil(6)` = `(endmant−1+5)/6`,
  over-counting one group when `(endmant−1) mod 6 ∈ {2,3}` and reading
  an extra 7-bit exponent word (drifting the bit cursor). Corrected to
  the §7.1.3 form `(endmant−1+3)/6`, matching the AC-3 path.

### Changed

- **Per-channel fsnroffst encoder policy** — round 95. Replaces the
  round-23 index-order round-robin in `tune_snroffst_with_plan` with
  a two-stage greedy that closes the asymmetry r91's per-channel
  PSNR gates exposed (channel 0 reaching `fsnroffst_ch=15` while
  siblings stayed at the global baseline).
  * **Stage 1 — equalise.** Each round we bump every channel
    currently at the minimum `fsnroffst_ch` that still fits the
    frame budget. Every fbw channel reaches `min(fsnroffst_ch)`
    before any one runs ahead.
  * **Stage 2 — spread-capped residual.** A channel only enters the
    free-bump pass if `fsnroffst_ch[ch] - min(fsnroffst_ch[..]) <
    FAIR_SPREAD` (FAIR_SPREAD=2, ≈1.5 dB per-channel SNR variance).
    This prevents a cheap-mantissa channel from monopolising slack
    that the spec lets a single channel claim.
  ATSC A/52:2018 §5.4.3.40 only defines the bitstream field; the
  encoder's choice of value is non-normative (Annex C reference
  encoder suggests balancing the per-channel SNR). New regression:
  `tune_snroffst_per_channel_spread_bounded` synthesises a
  5-channel exponent grid with one cheap-bump channel and four
  expensive-bump channels and asserts the post-tune
  `max(fsnroffst_ch) - min(fsnroffst_ch) ≤ 3` — pre-r95 this
  spread reached 14-15. The change is encoder-policy only and the
  existing per-channel PSNR floors (`two_two_psnr_per_channel`,
  `three_two_psnr_per_channel`, `five_one_psnr_per_channel`) hold
  unchanged on the 220×n Hz multitone fixture; PSNR is bap-cap-bound
  on those pure-sine inputs, so the fairness fix is visible in the
  per-channel `fsnroffst_ch` array (now `[2, 1, 1, 2, 0]` instead of
  `[15, 1, 1, 2, 0]` on the tight-budget redistribution frames) but
  not in the test PSNR numbers. New `AC3_DEBUG_PERCH_SNR=1` env var
  prints the post-tune `(csnr, fsnr, fsnr_ch, cpl_fsnr, lfe_fsnr)`
  tuple per frame for A/B sweeps.

### Added

- **2/2 + 5-channel PSNR regression coverage** — round 91. Adds
  `two_two_self_decode_roundtrip` for the previously-untested 4-fbw
  `acmod=6` (2/2 = L,R,Ls,Rs) path, plus a new
  `encode_decode_multichan_psnr` helper with per-channel lag-aligned
  PSNR (1024-sample correlator, ±2048-sample window) and three
  `*_psnr_per_channel` regression gates:
  * `two_two_psnr_per_channel` (4ch, acmod=6) — 24-32 dB per slot
  * `three_two_psnr_per_channel` (5ch, acmod=7) — 10-33 dB per slot
  * `five_one_psnr_per_channel` (6ch, acmod=7 + lfeon=1) — 10-33 dB
    per slot
  Floor is 10 dB per channel — matches the in-tree
  `tests/eac3_ffmpeg.rs::psnr_min` convention (18 dB AC-3 baseline
  via ffmpeg's reference decoder; self-decode tends to score a few
  dB lower than ffmpeg's smoothing-aware path). The 2/2 acmod=6
  spec-defined layout (per ATSC A/52 Table 5.8) had no prior
  encode-then-self-decode test — only `mono` (1/0), `three_zero`
  (3/0), `three_two` (3/2), `five_one` (5.1), and `two_one_lfe` (2.1)
  were exercised.
- **2.1 (L, R, LFE) encoder layout** — round 78 / r78. Adds a new
  acmod-emit path that maps a 3-channel input to `acmod=2 (2/0) +
  lfeon=1` instead of the default 3-channel `acmod=3 (3/0 L,C,R)`.
  Reached by setting `CodecParameters.channel_layout =
  Some(ChannelLayout::Stereo21)` on a 3-channel input; the
  count-alone path still defaults to 3/0 for backward compatibility.
  BSI emission already gated `cmixlev` (acmod ∈ {3,5,7}),
  `surmixlev` (acmod ∈ {4,5,6,7}), and `phsflginu` (acmod == 2)
  correctly; the 2.1 path picks up the `dsurmod` emit (acmod == 2)
  and routes LFE through the same per-channel exponent / bap /
  mantissa pipeline as 5.1. Two new test gates land alongside:
  `two_one_lfe_self_decode_roundtrip` (our decoder reads back per-
  channel RMS within tolerance) and `two_one_lfe_ffmpeg_crossdecode`
  (FFmpeg's reference decoder reports per-channel RMS within 0.2 %
  of the input — `[6610, 6118, 6336]` ours vs `[6611, 6108, 6336]`
  ffmpeg's). The full encoder acmod coverage is now 1/0, 2/0,
  2/0+LFE (2.1), 3/0, 2/2, 3/2, and 3/2+LFE (5.1).
- **E-AC-3 frame-based exponent strategy (`expstre == 0`)** — Table E2.10
  expansion (round 72). When the audfrm header carries `expstre == 0`,
  the per-block per-channel strategy codes are emitted as 32 spec-defined
  6-block runs indexed by a single 5-bit `frmcplexpstr` (when coupling
  is in use anywhere in the frame) and one 5-bit `frmchexpstr[ch]` per
  fbw channel (per A/52:2018 §E.2.3.2.12 / §E.2.3.2.13). The audfrm
  parser now expands these codewords via `FRAME_EXP_STRAT_TABLE[32][6]`
  (transcribed verbatim from ATSC A/52:2018 Annex E Table E2.10) into
  `cplexpstr_blk[]` and `chexpstr_blk_ch[][]`, so the audblk DSP
  consumes the same per-block shape it already does for the
  `expstre == 1` path. Every FFmpeg-encoded E-AC-3 fixture in the
  corpus picks `expstre == 0` — round 6's silent fallback hid this from
  the round-2 DSP path. Corpus deltas (E-AC-3 fixtures, prior baseline
  = 13.57 dB / silent):
  * `eac3-5.1-48000-384kbps` → **90.01 dB** (+76.4 dB)
  * `eac3-low-rate-stereo-64kbps` → **71.74 dB** (+58.2 dB)
  * `eac3-low-bitrate-32kbps` → **66.32 dB** (+52.7 dB)
  * `eac3-5.1-side-768kbps` → **21.32 dB** (+7.7 dB; SPX-blocked frames
    still mute and bleed into the overlap-add delay line)
  Remaining 3 fixtures (`eac3-stereo-48000-192kbps`,
  `eac3-256-coeff-block`, `eac3-from-ac3-bitstream-recombination`)
  exercise `spxinu == 1` blocks where the round-4 stub mutes — they
  decode block-0/block-1 cleanly then drop to silent on the first SPX
  frame. Implementing §E.2.2.5.4 spectral extension is the next E-AC-3
  blocker.

### Fixed

- **E-AC-3 coupling validity envelope widened to §5.4.3.12** (round 72).
  The audblk parser used to reject any block whose `cplbegf > cplendf`
  with `malformed coupling range`. Mirroring the round-7 AC-3 fix
  (commit `97d112f`), the spec's actual envelope is `ncplsubnd =
  3 + cplendf - cplbegf >= 1` — equivalently `cplbegf <= cplendf+2`
  — because §5.4.3.12 defines the upper sub-band index as `cplendf+2`.
  FFmpeg picks narrow configs like `(cplbegf=11, cplendf=10)` on
  high-bitrate 5.x frames; the strict check tripped on
  `eac3-5.1-48000-384kbps` frame 0 every syncframe and crashed the
  rest of the frame. Signed arithmetic prevents the `3 + cplendf -
  cplbegf` term from underflowing `usize` before the check fires.

### Fixed

- **Coupling-range validity check too strict for narrow-coupling streams**
  (round 7 / r7). The audblk parser rejected any frame whose `cplbegf >
  cplendf` with the message `§5.4.3.11/12 cplbegf > cplendf — malformed
  coupling range`. Per A/52:2018 §5.4.3.12, the upper sub-band index is
  `cplendf+2`, so the spec's actual envelope is `ncplsubnd = 3 + cplendf
  - cplbegf >= 1`, equivalently `cplbegf <= cplendf+2`. ffmpeg's
  encoder picks narrow `(cplbegf=11, cplendf=10)` configs on 5.0
  (acmod=7, lfeon=0) frames — placing coupling on sub-bands 11..=12
  (transform-coefficient bins 169..193, ~16-19 kHz at fs=48k) — and our
  too-strict check bombed every block 0 of every frame. The catch in
  `decode_frame` zeroed the coefficients on Err, then the next block
  inherited a corrupt bit cursor (the cpl-begf/-endf reads are AFTER
  cplinu / chincpl so the rejection was past the no-cpl path). PSNR on
  `ac3-3-2-48000-384kbps` (5.0): **6.49 dB → 88.85 dB** (+82.36 dB).
  Also moves to signed arithmetic for `ncplsubnd` so the `3 + cplendf
  - cplbegf` term can't underflow `usize` before the check fires.

- **Multichannel decoder output now in WAV-mask order** (round 6 / r6).
  AC-3 transmits multichannel layouts in `acmod` slot order
  (Table 5.8): 3/0 = `(L, C, R)`, 3/1 = `(L, C, R, S)`, 3/2 = `(L, C,
  R, Ls, Rs)`, with LFE appended as the last bitstream slot. Consumers
  that interpret the decoded PCM as a WAVE file (or any
  `WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE`-compliant sink such as `pcm_s16le`,
  foobar2000, or miniaudio) expect samples in `dwChannelMask` order:
  `(FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR)`. Stereo, mono, 2/1, 2/2, and 1+1 dual-mono
  paths already match WAV order; only `acmod ∈ {3, 5, 7}` (the
  front-center-bearing layouts) require permutation. The new
  `wave_order` module exposes `wave_to_bitstream_map(acmod, lfeon)` and
  `reorder_s16le_in_place(...)`, called once per syncframe in the
  passthrough decode path of both AC-3 (`decoder::process_ac3_frame`)
  and E-AC-3 (`decoder::process_eac3_frame`). Downmixed outputs
  (mono / stereo via `Downmix`) skip the reorder because the matrix
  emits in standard order. Verified against the docs corpus:
  `ac3-3-0-48000` jumps from 10.56 dB to **88.99 dB** PSNR vs FFmpeg;
  `ac3-3-2-lfe-48000-448kbps` (5.1) jumps from 11.97 dB to
  **90.42 dB**. The dep-substream-extended 7.1 case (indep 5.1 + dep
  `[Lb, Rb]`) keeps the trailing dep channels in append order — the
  bigger refactor needed to route them through the WAV 7.1 slot map
  is deferred (no fixture exercises it).

## [0.0.6](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-ac3/compare/v0.0.5...v0.0.6) - 2026-05-06

### Other

- drop dead `linkme` dep
- registry calls: rename make_decoder/make_encoder → first_decoder/first_encoder
- restore split-after-= form from 1de0dc2 (undo mistaken reformat)
- apply cargo fmt (rustfmt CI fix for round 30)
- rustfmt fix for band_is_tonal mean_exp_x8 line break
- ac3/eac3 encoder round 30: adaptive expstr + LFE spectral constraint + tonal DBA
- auto-register via oxideav_core::register! macro (linkme distributed slice)
- unify entry point on register(&mut RuntimeContext) ([#502](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-ac3/pull/502))

### Added

- **Tonal-vs-noise psy classification in DBA band selection** (round 30).
  Added `band_is_tonal` helper that measures the exponent spread
  (min vs. mean) within a frequency band across all 6 blocks. The
  `build_dba_plan` band picker now tracks per-band tonal votes and
  applies a large penalty (1 000 000) to mostly-tonal bands, steering
  the DBA target toward spectrally flat (noise-like) bands instead of
  bands that contain a dominant tone. This avoids raising the masking
  threshold at frequencies where the tone is perceptually salient.

- **Adaptive D15/D25/D45 exponent-strategy selection for E-AC-3**
  (round 30). The E-AC-3 encoder previously used a static
  `[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]` pattern (always D15 on anchor blocks, REUSE
  elsewhere). It now calls `select_exp_strategies` — the same adaptive
  per-channel smoothness test already used by the AC-3 encoder — to
  pick D15/D25/D45 per channel per anchor block. Smooth-spectrum
  channels emit D25 or D45, freeing ~430 bits/channel/anchor-block for
  mantissa precision. `EAC3_DISABLE_EXPSTR_SEL=1` reverts to static
  D15-only for A/B sweeps. `tune_snroffst_with_plan` receives the
  `chexpstr_plan` so the mantissa budget accounts for the exponent savings.

- **LFE spectral constraint (0–120 Hz)** (round 30). Both the AC-3 and
  E-AC-3 encoders now zero MDCT coefficients at bin ≥ 2 before exponent
  extraction, enforcing the spec §7.1.3 0–120 Hz LFE bandwidth limit
  (at 48 kHz, bin 0 ≈ 47 Hz; bin 1 ≈ 141 Hz). Bins 2..6 carry
  `exp=24 → bap=0 → no mantissa bits`, so `LFE_END_MANT=7` is
  unchanged for bitstream compatibility.

### Changed

- **`register` entry point unified on `RuntimeContext`** (task #502).
  The legacy `pub fn register(reg: &mut CodecRegistry)` is renamed to
  `register_codecs` and a new `pub fn register(ctx: &mut
  oxideav_core::RuntimeContext)` calls it internally. Breaking change
  for direct callers passing a `CodecRegistry`; switch to either the
  new `RuntimeContext` entry or the explicit `register_codecs` name.

## [0.0.5](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-ac3/compare/v0.0.4...v0.0.5) - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- *(clippy)* drop unnecessary i32→i32 casts + manual_memcpy in EAC-3 AHT

### Other

- task #467 — move chexpstr/cplexpstr/lfeexpstr from audblk to audfrm
- round 29 — D45 grpsize=4 anchor blocks now bit-exact
- round 28 — per-channel exponent strategy selection (D15/D25)
- round 6 (task #324) — Adaptive Hybrid Transform (AHT) decode
- round 5 — standard coupling decode for 5.1 + low-rate stereo
- round 4 stub — clarify AHT + SPX unsupported paths
- round 3 — dependent substream channel splice
- silence dead-code warning on round-3-only fields
- round 2 — per-block DSP via Ac3State translation

### Fixed — task #467 — E-AC-3 audfrm vs audblk exponent strategy bit placement

- **`chexpstr[blk][ch]`, `cplexpstr[blk]`, and `lfeexpstr[blk]` now live in
  `audfrm()` per ETSI TS 102 366 V1.4.1 §E.1.2.3 / Table E.1.3 (= ATSC
  A/52:2018 Annex E Table E1.3).** Earlier rounds put these per-block
  strategy codes inside `audblk()` (with a "round 2 fix" comment doubling
  down on the inversion). The spec text in §E.1.3.2.1 — "If the expstre
  bit is set to '1', the fields that carry the full exponent strategy
  syntax shall be present in **each audio block**" — refers to the
  per-block-indexed fields enumerated by the syntax table; those fields
  LIVE in audfrm, indexed by `[blk]`. Audblk (Table E.1.4) does NOT
  re-emit chexpstr/cplexpstr/lfeexpstr; it merely consumes them as state
  via `if(chexpstr[blk][ch] != reuse) {chbwcod[ch]; ...}` gates.
  ffmpeg follows the table verbatim; our streams misaligned by 12 bits
  per block (2 × nfchans), surfacing as the cascade
  `new bit allocation info must be present in block 0`,
  `delta bit allocation strategy reserved`, `error in bit allocation`.
- **`lfeexpstr[blk]` is now emitted unconditionally of `expstre`.** The
  `if(lfeon)` lfeexpstr loop sits OUTSIDE the `if(expstre)` branch in
  Table E.1.3. Previously we only emitted it when `expstre == 0`, which
  silently dropped 6 bits per LFE-on substream per syncframe.
- **`gainrng[ch]` (2 bits) restored after each per-channel exponent
  payload in audblk.** Table E.1.4 line: `gainrng[ch] 2`, immediately
  after the `nchgrps[ch]` group emit. The earlier "Annex E dropped
  gainrng" comment was wrong; gainrng is per-fbw-channel-only (LFE has
  no gainrng) and the bit MUST be consumed or every subsequent field
  in the audblk slides by 2 bits per non-REUSE channel.
- **`convsnroffste` (1 bit) emitted by encoder when `strmtyp == 0`.**
  Per Table E.1.4, the `if(strmtyp == 0x0) { convsnroffste; if(set)
  convsnroffst(10) }` block sits between fgaincode and cplleak,
  UNCONDITIONAL on snroffste. The encoder previously skipped it
  entirely; the dsp parser was already reading it (round 5 fix), so
  the asymmetry desync'd the wire stream.
- **Audfrm parser** now reads per-block per-channel `chexpstr` and
  per-block `cplexpstr` when `expstre==1`, and the per-block
  `lfeexpstr` array unconditionally of expstre. Two new fields on
  `AudFrm`: `chexpstr_blk_ch[6][5]` and `cplexpstr_blk[6]`. The
  test `parses_minimal_indep_stereo_audfrm` was updated to pack the
  6×2 chexpstr bits in the right slot.
- **Dsp module** now looks up chexpstr/cplexpstr/lfeexpstr from the
  parsed audfrm instead of re-reading them from the audblk byte
  stream. Added `let _gainrng = br.read_u32(2)?` after each per-channel
  exponent decode to consume the now-emitted bit.
- **Verification:** all three pre-existing E-AC-3 ffmpeg cross-decode
  tests pass: `eac3_stereo_192k_decodes_through_ffmpeg` →
  PSNR **20.21 dB** (above the 18 dB floor); `eac3_mono_96k_decodes_through_ffmpeg`
  → PSNR **20.21 dB**; `eac3_71_pair_decodes_through_ffmpeg` → ffmpeg
  reconstructs the full 8-channel program (chanmap honored) with
  L-energy 2844 across 49 152 samples. Full test run: 98 passed,
  0 failed across the lib + 5 integration suites.

### Fixed — round 29 — D45 grpsize=4 anchor blocks now bit-exact

- **`build_dba_plan` — clamp `hi_band` to 32 (was 45).** The DBA segment
  search picked a "quietest" mid-band in `[25, 45)`, then emitted that
  absolute band number as `deltoffst` (5 bits per §5.4.3.51). When the
  best band ≥ 32 the wire write silently truncated to `band & 31`,
  re-targeting the +6 dB mask delta at a low band the encoder never
  tagged. The decoder applied the delta at the wrong band → `bap[]`
  drifted by 1 at one bin → the rest of the frame's mantissa stream
  shifted by 1 bit. Cap the search at 32 so a single 5-bit segment can
  always reach its band; multi-segment dba would let us reclaim the
  upper region but costs more bits than the dba saves at our bitrates.
- **D45 (chexpstr=3) is now the default** when the strategy selector's
  smoothness probe permits — `AC3_DISABLE_D45=1` falls back to D25-only
  for A/B sweeps. Previously gated behind `AC3_ENABLE_D45=1` for the
  same reason as the dba fix above (the symptom looked like a D45
  emitter bug but it was a dba syntax bug masked by D25's different
  `build_dba_plan` exponent inputs).
- **Encoder defensive guard.** Added a `debug_assert!(offst <= 31)` to
  the dba emission so any future plan builder that overshoots the
  5-bit field range fails loudly instead of corrupting the bitstream.
- **Test gate `d45_exp_strategy_selection_and_ffmpeg_crosscheck`** —
  encodes a 110 Hz stereo tone, asserts ≥ 50% of frames carry
  `chexpstr=3` on an anchor block, asserts self-decode PSNR > 20 dB,
  asserts ffmpeg cross-decode succeeds with non-trivial PCM.
  Measured: 32/32 frames carry D45, self-decode PSNR 24.90 dB,
  ffmpeg-decode RMS 10767.

### Added — round 28 — per-channel exponent strategy selection (D25)

- **Encoder-side §7.1.3 / §5.4.3.22 chexpstr selection.** The encoder's
  anchor blocks (blocks 0 and 3 of each syncframe) now pick D15
  (grpsize=1) or D25 (grpsize=2) **per fbw channel** based on a
  smoothness probe of the post-`preprocess_d15` exponent array. Smooth
  channels emit D25 — `4 + 7×((end-1+3)/6)` bits per anchor block
  instead of D15's `4 + 7×((end-1)/3)`, saving ~290 bits per channel
  per anchor block at end_mant=253 (full-bandwidth uncoupled stereo).
  The freed bits are picked up automatically by the existing
  `tune_snroffst_with_plan` pass and reinvested in mantissa precision.
- **`select_exp_strategies`** — per-channel-per-block plan vector with
  the conservative "anchor on blocks 0 and 3, REUSE on 1/2/4/5"
  cadence preserved. Per-channel decisions: silent / smooth-tail
  channels can pick a coarser grpsize than transient / HF-rich
  channels in the same block.
- **`pick_strategy_for_block`** — sums the per-bin clipping cost of
  collapsing the spectrum to grpsize=2 and grpsize=4 spans (each
  clipped bin upcasts a mantissa bap by ≈1 bit, so the cost is in
  exp-units worth of dynamic range). Pick the largest grpsize whose
  per-bin avg clipping cost stays below thresholds tuned to the bit
  savings of each strategy. Thresholds are env-tunable via
  `AC3_EXPSTR_D25_THR` / `AC3_EXPSTR_D45_THR`; `AC3_FORCE_EXPSTR=N`
  pins all anchors to a fixed strategy for A/B sweeps.
- **`quantise_exponents_to_grpsize`** — replaces each grpsize-span
  with its minimum-exponent representative (covers the loudest bin
  in the span without clipping), then back-prop and forward-clamp the
  representative sequence so adjacent reps differ by at most ±2 (the
  AC-3 differential encoding limit). The bit allocator and mantissa
  quantiser see the same per-bin exponents the decoder will
  reconstruct after grpsize expansion, keeping bap[] in lockstep.
- **`write_exponents_grouped`** — generic 4-bit absexp + 7-bit packed
  groups emitter parameterised on grpsize; replaces the dedicated
  D15-only `write_exponents_d15` (which is now a thin wrapper).
- **`overhead_bits_for`** — accepts an optional per-channel-per-block
  chexpstr plan. When supplied, the per-channel exponent payload is
  computed from the actual emitted strategy instead of assuming D15
  for every channel, so `tune_snroffst`'s budget calculation matches
  the actual emitted byte count.
- **`AC3_ENABLE_D45` env-gated D45 path** — D45 emission has a
  first-frame-only mantissa desync the round didn't crack (per-bin
  exp arrays match between encoder/decoder post-grpsize expansion;
  the bit allocator delivers ~3 fewer mantissa bits in the decoder
  than the encoder writes during frame 1; subsequent frames are
  bit-exact). Disabled by default; leave the infrastructure in place
  for round 29 to land it once the desync is bracketed. D45 saves an
  additional ~145 bits/channel/anchor block over D25 when the
  spectrum is smooth enough.
- Test gate: `d25_exp_strategy_selection_and_ffmpeg_crosscheck` —
  encodes a 220 Hz + 440 Hz + 880 Hz stereo mix at 192 kbps,
  asserts every frame carries `chexpstr=2` on at least one fbw
  channel of an anchor block, and verifies ffmpeg decodes the
  resulting elementary stream into non-trivial PCM. Measured: 32 of
  32 frames pick D25 on at least one anchor; ffmpeg-decode RMS
  10190.

### Fixed — decoder defensive guard for end=0

- **`audblk::parse_audblk_into`** — guard `(end - 1) / k` underflow
  when a fully-coupled fbw channel has `cpl_begf_mant == 0`. Without
  the guard a corpus stream with that shape (unusual but spec-legal)
  would panic the decoder mid-frame instead of producing zero
  exponent groups for the channel. Surfaced by
  `tests/docs_corpus.rs::corpus_ac3_3_2_48000_384kbps`.

### Added — round 6 (task #324) — Adaptive Hybrid Transform (AHT)

- **VQ codebooks E4.1..E4.7** — 956 entries × 6 i16 transcribed
  verbatim from ATSC A/52:2018 (= ETSI TS 102 366 v1.4.1) Annex E §4
  into `src/eac3/tables/aht_codebooks.rs`. Spec values, not
  implementation source.
- **`src/eac3/aht.rs`** — AHT decode helpers:
    - `HEBAPTAB` — Table E3.1 high-efficiency bit-allocation pointer
      lookup (64 entries).
    - `HEBAP_MANT_BITS` — Table E3.2 mantissa bits per `hebap` for the
      scalar/GAQ regime (`hebap >= 8`).
    - `VQ_BITS` — codeword widths for VQ tables E4.1..E4.7
      (2/3/4/5/7/8/9 bits).
    - `vq_lookup(hebap, index)` — per-bin 6-tuple VQ lookup,
      Q15-normalised to (-1, 1).
    - `read_scalar_aht_mantissas` + Table E3.5 GAQ small/large
      quantiser with the §3.4.4.2 large-mantissa remap.
    - `idct_ii_6` — §3.4.5 inverse DCT-II that recovers per-block
      MDCT coefficients from the 6 AHT-domain values per bin.
    - `fill_gaqbin` / `gaq_sections` / `read_gaq_gains` — per
      §3.4.2 helper-variable derivation and per-channel gain-word
      bit-stream parsing.
- **`audfrm` two-phase parse** — `parse_with` now stops at the AHT
  anchor when `ahte == 1`, surfacing `AudFrm::aht_anchor_bits` +
  `aht_phase_b_pending`; a new `parse_phase_b(br, audfrm, bsi,
  hints)` consumes `chahtinu[ch]` / `cplahtinu` / `lfeahtinu`
  followed by the SNR / transient / SPX-attenuation / blkstrtinfo
  tail. Hints (`AhtRegsHints`) carry `nchregs[ch]` / `ncplregs` /
  `nlferegs` derived from the per-block exponent strategies.
- **dsp AHT path** — `decode_indep_audblks` keeps a per-channel AHT
  coefficient cache and dispatches AHT-active channels to a
  GAQ + VQ + IDCT mantissa decoder on the FIRST audblk where the
  channel emits exponents. Subsequent audblks pull pre-computed
  coefficients from the cache.
- **Round-6 scope is mono-only**: `nfchans == 1 && !lfeon &&
  ncplblks == 0`. Multichannel / coupled / LFE AHT mutes via an
  `Unsupported` early return — the iterative `nchregs` probe
  (§3.4.2) lands in round 7. The `eac3-low-bitrate-32kbps` corpus
  fixture is the only AHT-active fixture and matches the mono
  scope; round 6 unblocks its 14 of 17 AHT-on frames.

### Added

- Round 27 (task #187) — E-AC-3 dependent substream encode +
  multichannel scope expansion. The encoder now accepts 1, 2, 6,
  and 8 input channels (was 1 / 2 only):
    - **5.1 input (6 ch)** → single independent substream with
      `acmod=7` (3/2 L,C,R,Ls,Rs) and `lfeon=1`. The DSP path
      gained the LFE pseudo-channel exponent / mantissa pipeline
      (D15 over `bins[0..7]`, no chbwcod, `lfeexpstr` emitted in
      audfrm with the same D15-on-blocks-0-and-3 cadence used by
      the fbw channels).
    - **7.1 input (8 ch)** → the spec's §E.3.8.2 indep+dep pair.
      Indep substream is the 5.1 program built from the source's
      L,C,R,Ls,Rs,LFE; the dep substream is `strmtyp=1`,
      `substreamid=0`, `acmod=2`, `lfeon=0` carrying Lb/Rb with
      `chanmape=1` and `chanmap = 0x0200` (bit 6 of the 16-bit
      field — Lrs/Rrs pair per Table E2.5; bit 0 sits in MSB so
      the bit-6 mask is `1 << (15 - 6)`). The packet payload is
      the byte-concatenation of the two syncframes, both starting
      with `0x0B 0x77`. Default bitrates: 384 kbps indep + 192 kbps
      dep = 576 kbps total; user-supplied `bit_rate` is split
      preserving the same ratio.
  Refactor: the per-syncframe DSP body moved out of `Eac3Encoder::
  emit_syncframe` into `emit_substream(sub, frame_pcm)` which
  takes a `SubstreamLayout` (strmtyp / substreamid / acmod /
  lfeon / chanmap / src-PCM-index map / frame_bytes) and writes
  one E-AC-3 syncframe of size `sub.frame_bytes`. `emit_syncframe`
  drains 1536 samples per input channel and dispatches to one or
  two `emit_substream` calls based on the `Layout::Indep` /
  `Layout::Pair` configuration built at make-encoder time.
  Bitstream additions vs round 26:
    - `chanmape(1) [+ chanmap(16) when chanmape=1]` after `compre`
      in bsi when `strmtyp == 1` (§E.2.2.2 / E.2.3.1.7-8).
    - `lfeexpstr[blk]` (1 bit per block) inside audfrm when
      `lfeon=1` (§E.2.3.2.7).
    - LFE D15 exponents (4-bit absexp + 2 D15 groups) in audblks
      with new exponent strategy when `lfeon=1`.
    - `convexpstre` / `convsnroffste` skipped on `strmtyp==1`
      substreams (only emitted for indep streams per §E.2.2.3 /
      §E.2.2.4 syntax).
  Tests added (4 new tests; the eac3 unit-test cluster grows
  from 4 to 6 inside the lib, and the `eac3_ffmpeg` integration
  suite from 3 to 5):
    - `make_encoder_71_builds_pair_layout` — accepts 8 ch and
      asserts the chanmap MSB ordering math (`1 << (15 - 6) =
      0x0200` for the Lrs/Rrs-pair location bit).
    - `make_encoder_51_5fbw_plus_lfe` — accepts 6 ch at 384 kbps.
    - `eac3_71_emits_indep_plus_dep_substream_pair` — encodes 1 s
      of 7.1 sine, asserts each frame is exactly `1536 + 768 =
      2304 bytes`, that both halves start with the syncword, that
      the first half's `strmtyp` is 0, and that the second half's
      `strmtyp` is 1.
    - `eac3_71_pair_decodes_through_ffmpeg` — pipes the 7.1
      output through `ffmpeg -f eac3 -i …` and verifies ffmpeg
      reports either 6 or 8 channels (§E.3.8.1 reference decoder
      vs full 7.1 reassembler) with non-trivial Left-channel
      energy. The ffmpeg reference decoder accepts the stream
      cleanly.
  Existing test `make_encoder_rejects_unsupported_channels` was
  updated to test 4 channels (no longer in the allow-list) instead
  of 6 (now accepted as 5.1).

- Round 26 (task #170) — per-block SNR-offset bit-pool tuning. AC-3
  syntax §5.4.3.37-43 lets every audio block re-transmit a fresh
  `(csnroffst, fsnroffst[ch], cplfsnroffst, lfefsnroffst)` tuple via
  the `snroffste=1` flag; previously the encoder only emitted one
  global tuple on block 0 and reused it for blocks 1..5. The new
  `tune_per_block_snroffst` pass runs after the existing global
  `tune_snroffst` and redistributes mantissa bits between blocks based
  on per-block masking demand. Algorithm:
    1. Compute per-block PSD demand (mean of `3072 - (exp << 7)` over
       all bins / fbw channels) — silent blocks land near 24, loud
       blocks land at 800-1200+.
    2. Group blocks 0/1/2 vs 3/4/5 (the encoder's D15-on-blocks-0-and-3
       exponent strategy means each half shares an exponent set).
    3. Search `(down, up) ∈ [0, 8] × [0, 8]` step pairs: drop the
       donor half's whole-block fsnroffst by `down` (banks bits) and
       bump the recipient half by `up` (spends bits where the masking
       demand is highest). Accept the pair maximising `up - down`
       subject to the trial mantissa-bit count + per-block snroffste
       payload (~27 bits/changed-block for stereo) fitting the frame
       budget.
    4. Optional fine refinement via single-channel pair walks on the
       residual budget.
  When the demand spread is below threshold or the budget is too tight
  the pass returns the flat plan unchanged — `snroffste` reverts to
  block-0-only and the bitstream stays byte-identical to the previous
  encoder. `AC3_DISABLE_PERBLOCK_SNR=1` pins the flat plan for A/B
  testing; `AC3_DEBUG_PERBLOCK_SNR=1` prints the demand vector and
  the accepted (down, up) trial.
  Test gates (3 new tests, total = 57 active + 2 ignored):
    - `perblock_snroffst_self_decode` — encode 4 syncframes carrying a
      HF-rich chord burst on block 3 of each frame and silence
      elsewhere; verify our own decoder reads the per-block snroffst
      stream without complaint.
    - `perblock_snroffst_helps_transient` (ignored — mutates
      `AC3_DISABLE_PERBLOCK_SNR` so it must run alone) — A/B encodes
      the same fixture at 96 kbps stereo with vs without per-block
      tuning, asserts identical byte count and that the per-block path
      doesn't regress block-3 PSNR. Measured: per-block-tuned **32.91
      dB** vs flat **31.84 dB** (+1.07 dB localised on the demand-heavy
      block at matched bitrate).
    - `perblock_snroffst_ffmpeg_crossdecode` — encodes the same
      fixture and pipes through `ffmpeg -f ac3` to verify a production
      decoder accepts our snroffste-on-non-block-0 stream cleanly.

- Round 25 (task #155) — multichannel coupling: extended the encoder's
  §7.4 channel-coupling path from the previous 2/0-only restriction to
  every multichannel acmod (3/0, 2/2, 3/2, 5.1). All available fbw
  channels join the coupling group (`chincpl[ch]=1` for every fbw,
  matching the spec's 1..=5 limit; LFE is excluded by §7.4.1). The
  coupling-channel coefficients become the mean of every coupled
  channel's MDCT bin in `[37 + 12*cplbegf, 37 + 12*(cplendf+3))`, and
  per-channel cplco coordinates restore each channel's HF envelope on
  decode. With cplbegf=8 / cplendf=15 (the 2/0 baseline) the cpl region
  spans ~6 kHz upward, and 5.1 frees ~5× the per-channel HF mantissa
  budget — at 320 kbps for a 5-fbw HF-rich source this lifts the average
  fbw-channel self-decode PSNR from **20.82 dB** to **23.94 dB**
  (+3.12 dB at matched bitrate). The `AC3_DISABLE_CPL` env var still
  suppresses coupling for A/B testing; `AC3_TRACE_CPL_ENC=1` now prints
  the chincpl mask + per-channel mstr/cplco/cplcoexp/cplcomant arrays.
  Test gates (1 new test + 1 fix, total = 56 active + 2 ignored):
    - `five_one_coupling_beats_no_coupling_at_low_bitrate` (ignored —
      mutates `AC3_DISABLE_CPL` so it must run alone) — encodes the same
      5.1 HF-rich PCM with and without coupling at 320 kbps and
      asserts the coupled path beats the no-coupling path by ≥1 dB.
    - `five_one_ffmpeg_crossdecode` — already in the suite, now passes
      cleanly through ffmpeg's reference decoder. The previous output
      tripped libavcodec's "new coupling coordinates must be present in
      block 0" + "expacc out-of-range" parsers; both were rooted in the
      same bug below.
  Bitstream fix needed to reach this acceptance:
    - **§5.4.3.10 phsflginu gating** — the encoder used to emit the
      1-bit `phsflginu` field unconditionally on block 0 of every cpl
      strategy frame, but the spec defines the field only for `acmod ==
      0x2` (2/0 stereo). For multichannel acmods the phantom bit
      shifted every following block-0 cpl field by 1 bit, which
      cascaded into ffmpeg parsing the cpl-coord side info as garbage
      and then walking off into the cpl-exponent stream where it landed
      on impossible D15 packed values (the "expacc 127 out-of-range"
      messages). The encoder's own decoder masked the bug by reading
      phsflginu conditionally — same logic on both sides means
      self-decode round-tripped fine. Now `phsflginu` is written only
      when `acmod == 0x2`, matching `audblk::parse_audblk_side_info`.
    - **`overhead_bits_for`** correspondingly drops the 1-bit phsflginu
      contribution for non-2/0 acmods so `tune_snroffst`'s mantissa
      budget calculation matches the actual emitted bitstream length.
    - **`write_exponents_cpl`** — clamped `cplabsexp` to ≤12 (was 15)
      so the seed `(cplabsexp << 1)` cannot exceed 24. Pre-fix, the
      decoder's running exp could land at 30 + small negative delta
      = 28, breaching the §7.1.3 [0, 24] limit and tripping ffmpeg's
      "expacc out-of-range" check on the very first cpl D15 group. Add
      a debug_assert that catches any future regression of the same
      shape inside the encoder rather than at the consumer end.

- E-AC-3 (Enhanced AC-3) encoder per ATSC A/52:2018 Annex E, round-1
  scope: a single independent substream (`strmtyp=0`, `substreamid=0`,
  `bsid=16`) carrying mono (acmod=1) or stereo (acmod=2) audio at
  32 kHz / 44.1 kHz / 48 kHz, 6 audio blocks per syncframe
  (`numblkscod=3`), no coupling, no spectral extension (`spxinu=0`),
  no Adaptive Hybrid Transform (`ahte=0`), no transient pre-noise
  processing. New `eac3::make_encoder` constructor and
  `crate::CODEC_ID_STR_EAC3 = "eac3"` registration. The DSP pipeline
  (windowing, MDCT, exponent extraction + D15 strategy, parametric bit
  allocation, dba, mantissa quantisation) is shared with the AC-3
  encoder via newly-pub(crate) helpers (`extract_exponent`,
  `preprocess_d15`, `compute_bap`, `tune_snroffst`, `build_dba_plan`,
  `quantise_mantissa`, `write_exponents_d15`, `write_mantissa_stream`,
  `ac3_crc_update`, `BitAllocParams`, `CouplingPlan`, `DbaPlan`,
  `TransientDetector`, `decode_input_samples`). Framing diverges:
    - **syncinfo** (§E.2.2.1) is just the 16-bit syncword `0x0B77`;
      no `crc1` field.
    - **bsi** (§E.2.2.2) replaces AC-3's `bsid≤8` layout with
      `strmtyp(2) + substreamid(3) + frmsiz(11) + fscod(2) +
      numblkscod(2) + acmod(3) + lfeon(1) + bsid=16(5) + dialnorm(5)
      + compre(1) + mixmdate(1) + infomdate(1) + addbsie(1)`.
      `frmsiz = (frame_size_in_words - 1)` per §E.2.3.1.3 — the size
      table from AC-3's §5.4.1.4 is gone.
    - **audfrm** (§E.2.2.3) sits between bsi and the audblks and
      carries frame-level strategy flags (`expstre=1, ahte=0,
      snroffststr=0, transproce=0, blkswe=1, dithflage=1, bamode=1,
      frmfgaincode=1, dbaflde=1, skipflde=1, spxattene=0`), per-block
      coupling-strategy flags (`cplinu[0..5]=0`), per-block per-channel
      `chexpstr[blk][ch]` (2 bits each), per-channel `convexpstr[ch]`
      (5 bits each, value=0 = D15 + 5×REUSE per Table E2.10), and the
      shared frame-level `frmcsnroffst(6) + frmfsnroffst(4)`.
    - **audblk** (§E.2.2.4) emits `blksw + dithflag + dynrnge=0 +
      spxinu=0 + (rematrix flags when acmod==2) + chbwcod (D15 blocks
      only) + exponents (D15 blocks only) + bamode params (block 0)
      + fgaincode=0 (default fgaincod=4 for all chans) + convsnroffste=0
      + dba + skiple=0 + mantissas`. The `snroffststr=0` choice means
      every channel reads the same `frmfsnroffst` from the audfrm —
      `compute_bap` is fed the base `fsnroffst` (NOT the per-channel
      `fsnroffst_ch[ch]` array the AC-3 path uses) so encoder and
      decoder derive identical bap[] arrays.
    - **errorcheck** (§E.2.2.6) is just `encinfo(1) + crc2(16) = 17
      bits`. crc2 covers bytes `[2..frame_bytes-2]` with the same
      polynomial and initial value as AC-3 §6.1.7 (Annex E doesn't
      redefine the CRC).
  Test gates (3 new tests, total = 56):
    - `eac3_first_frame_is_syncframe` — every 768-byte boundary in
      a 192 kbps stereo stream starts with `0x0B 0x77`.
    - `eac3_stereo_192k_decodes_through_ffmpeg` — encode 1 s of
      440 Hz stereo, decode through `ffmpeg -f eac3 -i …`, assert
      PSNR ≥ 18 dB. Measured: **20.21 dB** (matches the AC-3 baseline
      encoder's PSNR-vs-ffmpeg on the same input — ~20.7 dB).
    - `eac3_mono_96k_decodes_through_ffmpeg` — same shape for mono,
      96 kbps. Measured: **20.21 dB**.

### Fixed

- Round 24 (task #103) — replaced the ad-hoc first-difference + 4×
  energy-ratio transient detector with a spec-faithful §8.2.2
  implementation: a 4th-order Butterworth high-pass at 8 kHz cutoff
  (cascaded direct-form-I biquads) followed by the hierarchical
  three-level peak-ratio test (T₁=0.1, T₂=0.075, T₃=0.05) with a
  `100/32768` silence threshold. Per-channel state holds the biquad
  memory and the previous block's last-segment peaks so the cross-
  block "k=1" comparisons of step 4 work as written. The previous
  detector mis-fired on low-frequency pure tones (e.g. 220 Hz sine):
  its 32-sample sub-frame energy ratio crossed 4× whenever a sub-
  frame happened to land near the sine's zero-crossing, triggering
  the 256-point short MDCT on a steady-state signal. Short MDCT on
  a pure tone smears the bin energy across multiple bins, dropping
  the ffmpeg-cross-decode L-channel PSNR on the 5.1 fixture from a
  spec-expected ~24 dB down to **14.36 dB**. After the fix the
  L-channel reads **24.54 dB** (+10.2 dB), matching the other fbw
  channels' bit-allocation ceiling. The decoder side was already
  correct; this was strictly an encoder transient-decision bug.
  `transient_roundtrip_self_decode` had its synthetic-burst fixture
  re-shaped (sharper σ=12 sample envelope at 4/8 kHz carrier) so the
  bursts carry meaningful HF content for the 8 kHz HPF to pass — the
  old σ=32 / 800-2400 Hz bursts were below the spec detector's
  threshold and would trip a regression test that documents real
  detector behaviour.

### Added

- Round 24 (task #103) — per-channel `fsnroffst[ch]` tuning
  (§5.4.3.40). `BitAllocParams` now carries a `[u8; MAX_FBW]` array
  of per-channel fine-SNR offsets; after the global `(csnr, fsnr)`
  selection the tuner does a greedy per-channel sweep that bumps
  individual channels' `fsnroffst[ch]` as long as the residual frame
  budget allows. Previously every fbw channel emitted the same
  `fsnroffst` value, leaving budget on the table when one channel's
  mask had more headroom than its peers. The bitstream syntax always
  allowed per-channel emission; the encoder just wasn't using it.

- Round 19 — multichannel encoder. The encoder now accepts `channels`
  ∈ 1..=6 with per-channel-count acmod selection per A/52 Table 5.8:
    - `1` → acmod=1 (1/0 mono)
    - `2` → acmod=2 (2/0 L,R)             — unchanged from earlier rounds
    - `3` → acmod=3 (3/0 L,C,R)
    - `4` → acmod=6 (2/2 L,R,Ls,Rs)
    - `5` → acmod=7 (3/2 L,C,R,Ls,Rs)
    - `6` → acmod=7 + lfeon=1 (3/2 + LFE — canonical 5.1 layout
      L,C,R,Ls,Rs,LFE)
  BSI emission switches on acmod for the `cmixlev` / `surmixlev` /
  `dsurmod` optional fields per §5.4.2.4-7 + Tables 5.9 / 5.10 (we
  emit the spec-default `01` = -3 dB centre/surround coefficient when
  applicable). LFE pipeline added end-to-end: separate exponent
  extraction over bins 0..7 (§5.4.3.29), `lfeexpstr` 1-bit per block
  per §5.4.3.23, LFE-specific bap routine (LFE never short-blocks
  per §5.4.3.1, no DBA per §5.4.3.47, dedicated `lfefsnroffst /
  lfefgaincod` SNR knobs per §5.4.3.42-43), and LFE mantissas
  emitted last per the §7.3.2 read order. Coupling and rematrix
  remain 2/0-only as the spec requires (`acmod==2` gate). Default
  bit rates per channel count: 1→96, 2→192, 3→256, 4→320, 5→384,
  6→448 kbps. Test gates:
    - `mono_self_decode_roundtrip`
    - `three_zero_self_decode_roundtrip`
    - `three_two_self_decode_roundtrip`
    - `five_one_self_decode_roundtrip`
    - `five_one_ffmpeg_crossdecode` — encodes 5.1 input with a
      unique tone per channel + an 80 Hz sub-bass on LFE, decodes
      via ffmpeg, asserts every channel survived (per-channel RMS
      gate) and reports per-channel PSNR after WAVEEX channel
      reorder. Measured per-channel PSNR on 0.5s tonal fixture at
      448 kbps: L 14.4 dB, C 24.1 dB, R 44.7 dB, Ls 24.2 dB,
      Rs 24.7 dB, LFE 28.4 dB.
- Round 18 — encoder-side §7.2.2.6 / §5.4.3.47-57 delta bit allocation.
  Encoder now emits `deltbaie=1` on block 0 of every syncframe with a
  per-fbw-channel single-band segment (`deltbae[ch]=1`, `deltnseg=1`),
  picked greedily from the lowest-energy 1/6th-octave band in the 25..45
  range with `deltba=4` (+6 dB mask boost). Coupling channel signals
  `cpldeltbae=2` (no delta this block) when coupling is active. Blocks
  1..5 emit `deltbaie=0` (reuse) — block-0's segment list applies for
  the rest of the syncframe. `tune_snroffst` accounts for the dba
  syntax cost (≈17 bits per fbw channel + 2 bits per channel for
  `deltbae[ch]` + 2 bits for `cpldeltbae` when cpl is in use), and
  `compute_bap` / `compute_bap_cpl` apply the dba mask offsets before
  bap[] computation so encoder and decoder derive identical bap[]
  arrays. ffmpeg cross-decodes the dba-bearing stream cleanly.
  `AC3_DISABLE_DBA=1` reverts to the round-17 deltbaie=0 behaviour for
  A/B comparison. Test gate: `dba_self_decode_and_ffmpeg_crosscheck`.
- §7.2.2.6 delta bit allocation: persistent per-channel + coupling deltba
  segment state on `Ac3State`, parsed per Table 5.16 (`new info / reuse /
  no delta` semantics) and applied to the masking curve before bap[]
  computation. Dormant on the current transient-burst fixture (the
  encoder there sets cpldeltbae and per-fbw deltbae[] to '10' = no
  delta) but required-by-spec for any stream that does signal mask
  offsets — without it our bap[] would diverge from the encoder's and
  desync mantissa unpacking.
- `examples/sample_compare.rs`: per-block PSNR + peak-diff diagnostic for
  drilling into burst frames where the per-frame floor hides which
  audblk is breaking. Used to characterise the round-7 drift pattern
  (errors ramp through frame 14 blk 0..5, peak in frame 15 blk 0-1,
  unwind through frame 15 blk 2-5).

### Fixed

- §7.5.2.2 / §7.5.2.3 rematrix band 3 upper bound: was hard-coded to
  bin 252 even when coupling was active, allowing the L+R / L-R operation
  to bleed into the just-decoupled coupling region. Now tracks
  `36 + 12*cplbegf` per Tables 7.26 / 7.27 when `cplinu == 1`. No PSNR
  movement on the current fixture (end_mant capped the bleed there
  anyway) but a latent correctness fix for streams where the per-channel
  bandwidth code reaches further.

### Investigation notes (transient fixture, round 7)

Root-causing the residual ≈15 dB transient PSNR floor — outcome: not
cracked this round, but the bug is now bracketed substantially tighter
than the round-6 notes left it.

Per-block sample_compare on frame 14 of the bursts fixture shows the
error grows monotonically through the frame (28, 22, 16, 11, 8, 6 dB
across blocks 0..5), peaks in frame 15 blk 0-1 (4.4 / 4.7 dB), then
unwinds symmetrically. Peak amplitudes: ours ≈ 0.36 × ffmpeg's on the
worst blocks — i.e. our reconstruction is roughly the right *shape*
but the wrong *magnitude*, with a partial sign inversion appearing
specifically on burst-peak blocks. Probes that did NOT move the floor:

- spec-literal vs. swapped §7.9.4.2 short2 de-interleave (round 6's
  deviation makes no PSNR difference on this fixture either way)
- disabling coupling decoupling entirely (`AC3_DISABLE_DECOUPLE=1`)
- disabling rematrix entirely (`AC3_DISABLE_REMAT=1`)
- the new dba application (encoder sends only "no delta" markers in
  this fixture's burst blocks)

These eliminate IMDCT short-block, coupling decode, rematrix matrix,
AND dba as the dominant error sources. What remains in the per-frame
error budget is bit allocation (bap[]) on the burst-onset blocks
themselves — specifically the masking-curve computation around bins
4-5 (the dominant 440 Hz tone) where calc_lowcomp's break condition
`bndpsd[bin] <= bndpsd[bin+1]` fires under burst conditions and the
spec-vs-implementation behaviour at that exact moment is hardest to
verify without a known-correct reference trace.

Next round should: (a) instrument bndpsd[0..7], excite[0..7], mask[0..7],
and bap[0..7] for ch0 in frame 14 blk 0 (28 dB — easiest to reverse-
engineer the divergence) and compare against a hand-calculated trace
from §7.2.2.4 pseudo-code with the same exponents we decoded; and
(b) consider whether the burst-frame bap[] divergence might come from
our exponent decode chain itself (D15 → cumulative sum of M-2 deltas)
when consecutive deltas straddle the 5-level map saturation boundary,
since the burst fixture is where extreme M=0 / M=4 codes appear.

### Fixed

- `BAPTAB` (Table 7.16): off-by-one at positions 26 and 30 that was
  shifting every bap in the 23..=34 range by one, mis-quantizing
  mid-band mantissas. PSNR vs ffmpeg on the 440 Hz sine fixture
  jumps from 35.7 dB to 92.0 dB as a direct result.
- `MASKTAB` (Table 7.13): off-by-one at rows A=8, 9, 10, 15 that was
  mapping four high-frequency mantissa bins into the wrong 1/6 octave
  band, skewing bit-allocation masking on wide-bandwidth content.
- `LATAB` (Table 7.14) entry 151: `0x0002` → `0x0003` to match spec
  Table 7.14, row A=15 column B=1.

### Added

- `tests/fixtures/transient_bursts_stereo.ac3`: three Gaussian tone
  bursts, 62 short-block audblks across 63 frames, exercising the
  `blksw=1` IMDCT path that the sine fixture never touches.
- `decoder_matches_ffmpeg_on_transient_fixture` PSNR gate for the
  short-block / block-switching regression.
- `decoder_matches_ffmpeg_within_psnr_floor` gate ratcheted from
  25 dB to 80 dB now that the BAPTAB fix lands.
- `examples/count_blksw`, `examples/psnr_per_frame` diagnostic
  tools for inspecting short-block coverage and per-frame decode
  quality.

### Changed

- `audblk::imdct_256_pair` direct-form short-block IMDCT is now
  `#[cfg(test)]`-only. The §7.9.4.2 FFT decomposition
  (`imdct::imdct_256_pair_fft`) is canonical; the naive per-half
  reference disagrees with it (see the
  `short_block_direct_form_diverges_from_fft` regression test).

### Investigation notes (transient fixture drift)

Round 6: investigated the remaining 15.5 dB PSNR floor on the
transient-burst fixture (bursts at frames 14-17, 29-32, 45-48).
Outcome: no code change lands this round — the previously-suspected
`run_bit_allocation` divergence on bins 4-5 at burst onset was
traced line-by-line against ATSC A/52:2018 §7.2.2.4 and every
reachable value (`lowcomp`, `fastleak`, `slowleak`, `excite[]`,
`mask[]`, `bap[]`) agrees with the spec's pseudocode for the
`bndstrt==0` fbw path (including the break at bin=2 when
`bndpsd[2] <= bndpsd[3]` as bursts rise).

Remaining symptom on burst frames: the time-domain output at the
dominant 440 Hz MDCT bin emerges with roughly the wrong sign (our
output is ≈ −0.77 × reference across the burst). Localised probes
(zero bins 4-5, flip bin 4, flip bin 5, zero entire burst blocks,
disable dither, force long blocks) each shift burst-frame PSNR by
≤4 dB — i.e. the error is not concentrated in any single bin or
DSP stage that the probes touched. Rematrix flags are all zero in
this fixture and coupling coefficients (bins 133-216) are all
`exp=24` / `bap=0`, so neither pathway is contributing.

Further investigation should: (a) compare our decoded
pre-IMDCT coefficient array against a reference MDCT of the
ffmpeg-decoded PCM for burst frame 15 block 0 to pinpoint which
bin's magnitude or sign disagrees, and (b) re-check the §7.1.3
grouped-exponent prefix sum when consecutive deltas sit near the
boundary of the 5-level map (M1=0 or M1=4), since the burst psd
profile is where those extremes actually appear.
